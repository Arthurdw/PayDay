# PayDay 💰📊

PayDay is a personal finance app built with Laravel and Vue TypeScript. It allows you to effortlessly manage your expenses and keep track of the companies where you spend your hard-earned 💸.

## Features

* 📉 Track and manage your expenses
* 🔎 Explore detailed breakdowns of your spending habits
* 🏢 Keep tabs on the companies where you spend your money
* 💼 View comprehensive reports and analytics
* 📊 Intuitive and user-friendly interface

## Folder Structure

* `client`: Contains the Vue code for the frontend client
* `server`: Houses the Laravel code for the backend server
* `spec`: Contains the Swagger specification for the API

## Future Enhancements

Although the Laravel code may not be a point of pride, the Vue client code is intriguing and showcases the app's potential. In future iterations, I plan to adopt a more test-driven development approach, ensuring robustness and reliability. Additionally, we will prioritize internationalization to make the app accessible to a wider audience.
